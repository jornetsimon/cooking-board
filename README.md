# But why?

MoumouPad was created as a gift for my fiancé, who likes to plan the meals for every week 🎁. After crafting a magnetic board with erasable whiteboard cards, I quickly figured it could be turned into an app to live on a fridge iPad.

Tadaaa! 🪄 MoumouPad was born, named after her nickname.

It's just a simple personally project with no other ambition than serving our own needs. I keep adding small features to make our day-to-day lives easier and more fun. 💕

For now the app it still French only, but I do plan to internationalize it in the future, just for fun. 🌍
